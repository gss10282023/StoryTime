## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in StoryTime:

1. Prefer using GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled for the repository).
2. Otherwise, open an issue with enough detail to reproduce and label it clearly (avoid posting secrets).

We will respond as quickly as we can and coordinate a fix and release when appropriate.
