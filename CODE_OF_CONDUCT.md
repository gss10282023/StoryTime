- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
